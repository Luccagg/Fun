**The challenge is to hack into a python webserver that when receiving a GET request from a client runs some of the content of that request as an input for the python interpreter running in the server.**
So the first step is to deploy the challenge machine in the thm platform, we get the challenge machine ip address as 10.201.65.80, this is an ip from a private network, so we connect to the network of the tryhackme platform using the command `sudo openvpn Downloads/user.ovpn`
